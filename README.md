This is an early version of what could be a meshtastic iOS app. Right now, messages that are sent/received are not stored persistently.
Any help from testers and other iOS developers is appreciated.

- Set device config and owner information

## Roadmap
- Show time and date in chat messages
- Implement persistent storage
- Add a map with nearby devices
- Add QR-Code functionality
- Refine user interface
- App Store release?
